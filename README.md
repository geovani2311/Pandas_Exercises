## Data Cleaning Techniques with Pandas Using the Gasoline Price Dataset in Brazil
aims to demonstrate various approaches and methods for data cleaning and preparation using Python's Pandas library. The dataset used contains information on gasoline prices in Brazil, allowing for the exploration of different types of inconsistencies and common challenges in real-world datasets.

Throughout the project, techniques such as:

Handling missing and duplicate values
Standardizing data formats
Converting data types
Detecting and correcting outliers
Manipulating and transforming columns
Additionally, practical examples and code scripts are provided to illustrate how to efficiently apply these techniques. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and detailed guide for data analysts and data scientists who wish to enhance their data cleaning skills, using a real and relevant use case.
